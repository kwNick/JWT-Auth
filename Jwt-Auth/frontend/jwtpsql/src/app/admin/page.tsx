                        To delete a user, you can use the <code>DELETE</code> HTTP method on the endpoint:
                    </p>DELETE on http://localhost:8080/api/delete`
                    <p>
                        Note: Make sure to handle this operation carefully as it will permanently remove the user and their associated data.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
